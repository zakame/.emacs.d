#+TITLE: My Emacs Settings

My [[./init.el][init.el]] inspired by [[http://emacsrocks.com][Emacs Rocks]] and [[https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d][Magnars' .emacs.d]].

* Setup

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cd $HOME
  git clone https://github.com/zakame/.emacs.d.git
  #+END_SRC

  It is best to do the initial load under an xterm first:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  command emacs -nw
  #+END_SRC

  For subsequent runs, =emacsclient -c -n= is preferred.

* Notes

  My Emacs settings is primarily optimized for a Perl web development
  environment with Git support.  Furthermore, it has some older
  customizations that come from my old =.emacs= setup for misc stuff.
